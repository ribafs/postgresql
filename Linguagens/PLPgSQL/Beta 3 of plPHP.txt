PL/PHP is a loadable procedural language that enables you to write PostgreSQL functions 
in the PHP programming language. 

It currently supports triggers, trusted, and untrusted modes. 

It is the hope that this will be the last beta before RC status is achieved. 

New features include the ability to access trigger operations, e.g; 
$_TD["new"] 
An associative array containing the values of the new table row for INSERT/UPDATE 
actions, or empty for DELETE. The array is indexed by field name. Fields that are 
NULL will not appear in the array! 

$_TD["old"] 
An associative array containing the values of the old table row for UPDATE/DELETE 
actions, or empty for INSERT. The array is indexed by field name. Fields that are 
NULL will not appear in the array! 

$_TD["name"] 
contains the trigger name. 

$_TD["event"] 
contains the event as a string (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or UNKNOWN). 

$_TD["when"] 
contains one of BEFORE, AFTER, and UNKNOWN. 

$_TD["level"] 
contains one of ROW, STATEMENT, and UNKNOWN. 

$_TD["relid"] 
contains the relation ID of the table on which the trigger occurred. 

$_TD["relname"] 
contains the relation name. 

$_TD["argc"] 
contains the arguments count.
