			MySQL vs PostgreSQL 	
			===================
			
Name: Alex Wibowo

Purpose of the Research:
=======================
To compare the performance of MySQL vs PostgreSQL, and pick one DBMS which
best suites for the system that is needed by the client of Team Wasabi.
 
Time spent on the research:
	Start date: March 24th, 2004, 11:30am
	End date: March 25th, 2004, 5:00pm
	Total Hours:  3 hours.


Overview: 
=========
With minimizing cost as the main objective of the client, open source DBMS is certainly a 
choice over proprietary DBMS such as SQL Server. Two such DBMS are PostgreSQL and MySQL.
Rather than having in an endless dicussion on which DBMS is better than which, this research 
points out the merits of each DBMS. 


- PostgreSQL natively supports subqueries, stored procedures, cursors or views, 
  transcation/relational integrity. Although the old version of MySQL does not support 
  most of these features, the new version of MySQL has begin to supports them. 
- Finding helps on MySQL is much easier than that on PostgreSQL. Although PosgreSQL has an 
  active mailing lists, MySQL ish much more widely used and hence, there is a larger community 
  ready to assist when we are encountering problems. In addition, there are more references 
  available (both online and books) on MySQL.
- Although both DBMS has GUI tools (phpMyAdmin for MySQL and phpPgAdmin for PostgreSQL), the 
  tool for PostgreSQL is not as well-developed as the one for MySQL.
- Most members of Team Wasabi have done / currently doing 433-351 Database Systems, a subject 
  from Computer Science department which teaches how to use MySQL. There is less learning curve 
  here if we use MySQL. 
- With the advanced features, PostgreSQL seems to be more stable than the newer MySQL equivalents, 
  having been implemented for longer. Some users reported table corruption in MySQL, but they had 
  never had a problem recovering the tables (using REPAIR TABLE), furthermore, these faults could
  always be blamed on faulty hardware. 
- MySQL has two type of tables: non-transactional MyISAM tables and transaction-capable InnoDB tables.
- MySQL is aimed first to be a fast database, while PostgreSQL is aimed first to be a fully-featured 
  database, and both are converging in the other's direction.
- MySQL is not fully compliant with ANSI SQL standard, while PostgreSQL is. In the other hand, 
  MySQL is closer to the ODBC standard. 
- People claims that additional features from PostgreSQL degrade its performance for web 
  applications.


			POSTGRESQL  			MYSQL
ANSI SQL compliance 	Closer to ANSI SQL standard 	Follows some of the ANSI SQL standards
Performance 		Slower 				Faster
Sub-selects 		Yes 				No
Transactions 		Yes 				Yes, however InnoDB table type must be used
Database replication 	Yes 				Yes
Foreign key support 	Yes 				No
Views 			Yes 				No
Stored procedures 	Yes 				No
Triggers 		Yes 				No
Unions 			Yes 				No
Full joins 		Yes 				No
Constraints 		Yes 				No
Windows support 	Yes 				Yes
Vacuum (cleanup) 	Yes 				No
ODBC 			Yes 				Yes
JDBC 			Yes 				Yes
Different table types 	No 				Yes

Some reasons for using MySQL over PostgreSQL
    * MySQL is relatively faster than PostgreSQL.
    * Database design will be simpler.
    * You can create a basic Web-driven Web site.
    * MySQL's replication has been thoroughly tested.
    * There's no need for cleanups in MySQL (Vacuum).


Some reasons for using PostgreSQL over MySQL
    * Complex database design
    * Moving away from Oracle, Sybase, or MSSQL
    * Complex rule sets (i.e., business rules)
    * Use of procedural languages on the server
    * Transactions
    * Use of stored procedures
    * Use of geographical data
    * R-Trees (i.e., used on indexes)

Recommendations:
================
Considering the advantages and disadvantages for the two alternatives above,
I would like to recommend the use of MySQL. It has better performance for
web application, which is what needed for this project. Although PostgreSQL
seems to support more features than MySQL does, most of these features
can be implemented manually. MySQL also supports several table types
that are geared towards the need, namely InnoDB and MyISAm. Last but not least, most 
members of Team Wasabi are comfortable with MySQL.
