Using PostgreSQL
pg_dump: dumps your database into a file
check out 'pg_dump --help' for more info.
THis command will back-up schema and data for a specific table

% pg_dump -D -f /menu_items.sql -F p -N -t menu_items -U postgres domus
; Another example
% pg_dump -D -f /content_items.sql -F p -N -t content_items -U postgres domus

; -D = to dump data as INSERT not COPY
; -f [file] = output file name
; -F p = output in plain text
; -N = something neat
; -t [table] = table name
; -U [user] the person I connect as
; [database] = database you want to access

Here's how you would put the data back in the database
% psql < ./menu_items.sql -U postgres domus   
% psql < ./content_items.sql -U postgres domus

Backup com Crontab

restore with crontab???

Anyway.
Put a line in crontab like:
3  5 * * * /script/backdb.sh

and the script  /script/backdb.sh
could then look like:

#!/bin/bash
DATE=`date +%Y%m%d`
/usr/pgsql/bin/pg_dump databas > /tmp/dump.$DATE

then you have a file in /tmp/dump.$DATE that you could put on tape or whatever
you use. Use pg_dumpall if you want all databases.
You might want to consider making a  backup of the files  (for example
pg_hba.conf) in  PGDATA directory. Read the man page for details about OID's.

Good luck.
Gunnar.
